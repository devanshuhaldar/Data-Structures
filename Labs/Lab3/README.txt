Notes Checkpoint 2 Lab 2.

-line.cpp
	 file if statements can cause errors. First you need to have a end of the function return statement. For example , if both gradient_m and gradient_n
equal eachother the function is basically useless.
	What is gradient * -1; gonna do
	included both point.h and line.h. Which is wrong. just needed only line.h. So I removed point.h

-roads.cpp 
	using sort function with a std:: and need to inclue #include algorithim 
	i needs to be a long unsigned int. (line 31) Also since it is going to become a long unsigned int there is no need for i>=0; this will always be true
-point.cpp 
	never used the variable answer
